# Reflections â€“ PokÃ©mon Explorer

## ðŸ§  Motivation

The PokÃ©mon Explorer app was built to explore the capabilities of public APIs, develop client-side JavaScript proficiency, and produce a fully interactive UI with clean HTML/CSSâ€”no external libraries.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to consume RESTful APIs using `fetch()` and async/await
- DOM manipulation based on JSON data structures
- Design best practices for user experience: feedback, responsiveness, and accessibility
- Real-world edge case handling (e.g., typos in names, network errors)

## ðŸš§ Challenges Faced

- Normalizing user input (capitalization, trimming, removing `#`)
- Dealing with inconsistent or missing API sprite data
- Organizing UI sections responsively without using frameworks

## ðŸŽ¯ Future Goals

- Add autocomplete using `/pokemon-species/` endpoint
- Persist user search history via `localStorage`
- Animate transitions between PokÃ©mon cards
- Refactor using a component-based JS framework (e.g., React)

## ðŸ§¬ Final Thoughts

This project was a fun way to blend nostalgic content with modern web development practices. It taught me not only about API integration but also about designing with clarity and polish. I plan to continue evolving it into a more advanced single-page app.
